The second emphasized the role of trust and brand loyalty in influencing customers' choice of tire stores.
The third explored the effects of price-matching guarantees on retail tire pricing.
Refined Project Focus: While initially centered on profitability, the project shifted to focus on analyzing market potential for specific tire brands. This included examining macroeconomic factors such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), seasonality, weather patterns, employment data, and disposable income.

Data Analysis and Methods: Using Python, the team applied several analytical techniques:

Descriptive Statistics: To understand data size, distribution, and variable types.
Data Visualization: To create informative charts and graphs.
Correlation Analysis: To identify relationships between key variables.
Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values and outliers.
Segmentation Analysis: Categorized stores and customers.
